  **Note**: Adapt the introductory line (e.g., "Release notes here:", "Learn more:", "Get started:") based on context.

### Other Social Media (Twitter/X, etc.)

- **Focus**: Single key benefit or feature
- **Tone**: Playful and engaging, use emojis within reason
- **Include**: Relevant hashtags (#QlikSense, #DataEngineering, #Analytics)

## Writing Principles

### Do

- **Stick to facts** - Highlight real features and actual benefits
- **Be specific** - Use concrete examples over vague claims
- **Focus on value** - Explain why features matter to users' workflows
- **Use relatable scenarios** - "Imagine debugging a data issue..." or "You're working with a 50 GB QVD file..."
- **Maintain appropriate tone** - Professional for blog posts; more engaging and playful for social media
- **Show unique differentiators** - What makes Ctrl-Q QVD Viewer special compared to alternatives
- **Mention open source** - The tool is free, open source, and community-driven
- **Use emojis strategically** - Sparingly in blog posts; freely in LinkedIn/social media for engagement
- **Use clear structure** - Headers, bullet points, short paragraphs for scannability

### Don't

- **Avoid hype language** - No "revolutionary," "game-changing," or excessive superlatives
- **Skip overly silly tone** - Playful is good for social media, but avoid forced humor or unprofessional language
- **No hard selling** - Let features and benefits speak for themselves
- **Don't oversimplify** - Audience understands Qlik; respect their expertise
- **Avoid going too deep technically** - No code examples or complex implementation details (blog posts only)
- **Don't make unsupported claims** - Every statement should be factual

## Example Opening (Blog Post)

> When you're developing Qlik Sense applications, QVD files are everywhere—storing incremental data, optimizing load times, and serving as the backbone of your data architecture. But inspecting these files typically means opening Qlik Sense, loading them into an app, or using specialized utilities outside your normal workflow.
>
> For developers who already work in VS Code for scripting, documentation, or other development tasks, there's now a more integrated approach: the Ctrl-Q QVD Viewer extension brings QVD file inspection directly into your editor.
