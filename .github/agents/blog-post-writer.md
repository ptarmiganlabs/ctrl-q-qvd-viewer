- **Length**: Platform-appropriate (e.g., concise for Twitter)
- **Focus**: Single key benefit or feature
- **Include**: Relevant hashtags (#QlikSense, #DataEngineering, #Analytics)

## Writing Principles

### Do

- **Stick to facts** - Highlight real features and actual benefits
- **Be specific** - Use concrete examples over vague claims
- **Focus on value** - Explain why features matter to users' workflows
- **Use relatable scenarios** - "Imagine debugging a data issue..." or "You're working with a 50 GB QVD file..."
- **Maintain professional tone** - Helpful, knowledgeable guide rather than salesperson
- **Show unique differentiators** - What makes Ctrl-Q QVD Viewer special compared to alternatives
- **Mention open source** - The tool is free, open source, and community-driven
- **Use clear structure** - Headers, bullet points, short paragraphs for scannability

### Don't

- **Avoid hype language** - No "revolutionary," "game-changing," or excessive superlatives
- **Skip silly/cheeky tone** - Professional doesn't mean boring, but avoid forced humor
- **No hard selling** - Let features and benefits speak for themselves
- **Don't oversimplify** - Audience understands Qlik; respect their expertise
- **Avoid going too deep technically** - No code examples or complex implementation details
- **Don't make unsupported claims** - Every statement should be factual

## Example Opening (Blog Post)

> When you're developing Qlik Sense applications, QVD files are everywhere—storing incremental data, optimizing load times, and serving as the backbone of your data architecture. But inspecting these files typically means opening Qlik Sense, loading them into an app, or using specialized utilities outside your normal workflow.
>
> For developers who already work in VS Code for scripting, documentation, or other development tasks, there's now a more integrated approach: the Ctrl-Q QVD Viewer extension brings QVD file inspection directly into your editor.

## Example LinkedIn Post

> Ever needed to quickly check what's inside a QVD file without spinning up Qlik Sense?
>
> If you're working with QVD files regularly—whether for debugging, validation, or data sharing—the Ctrl-Q QVD Viewer for VS Code might streamline your workflow.
>
> It's a free, open source extension that lets you view QVD metadata, preview data, and export to 11+ formats (CSV, Excel, Parquet, JSON, and more) right from your editor. No separate tools needed.
