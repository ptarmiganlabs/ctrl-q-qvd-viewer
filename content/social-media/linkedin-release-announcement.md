# LinkedIn Release Announcement - Ctrl-Q QVD Viewer

## Post Content

Ever wished you could inspect QVD files without opening Qlik Sense? 🤔

I'm excited to share that Ctrl-Q QVD Viewer is now available for VS Code! 🎉

If you're a Qlik Sense or QlikView developer working with QVD files, this free, open source extension brings QVD inspection right into your editor. No context switching, no extra tools—just open a .qvd file and you're ready to go!

✨ **What can you do with it?**

📊 **View QVD data & metadata** - See field types, record counts, creation info, and lineage—all in a clean interface

📁 **Export to 11+ formats** - Need to share data? Export to CSV, Excel, JSON, Parquet, Arrow, Avro, PostgreSQL, SQLite, XML, YAML, or even Qlik inline script

⚡ **Smart pagination** - Handle large QVD files with configurable preview (100 to 100,000 rows)

🔒 **Read-only & safe** - No risk of accidentally modifying your QVD files

It's part of the Butler family of open source tools for Qlik Sense—built by the community, for the community. And it's completely free! 🆓

Whether you're debugging data loads, validating QVD structure, or bridging data between Qlik and other platforms, this tool is designed to fit seamlessly into your workflow.
